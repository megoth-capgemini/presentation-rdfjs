<aside className="notes">
    Using URLs as namespaces we can make our data models interoperable, either by reusing the vocabularies they're
    defined in, or translating between vocabularies. Here I've listed some common vocabularies used on the web today.
    You'll often see these prefixes used to simplify a URL to make it more human readable. (I've used `foaf` and
    `schema` extensively already in the previous example.)
