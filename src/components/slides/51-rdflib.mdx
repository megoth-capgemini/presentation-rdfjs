### rdflib.js

<aside className="notes">
    rdflib.js is the oldest JavaScript-library that's still used in development. It's age is apparent in some of its API
    design, but is by far the most reliable library out there. (An example of this is the use of callback functions on
    lines 9-12 and lines 21-24.)

    The data is initialized into memory by using the class `Store`, which is created by `graph()`. The class exposes API
    to add and remove statements, which we can see use of in lines 16-17. These methods take a statement, which for line
    16 is an existing triple we find by using `store.match`, and for line 17 is a new triple.

    Although rdflib.js sports a powerful API that's very useful to those that understand RDF well, it can be a daunting
    experience for developers who are unfamiliar to RDF.
