## Motivation

- RDF is a powerful way to describe data on the web
- JavaScript is the programming language of the web

    I'll go more into what RDF is in the next couple of slides, but sufficient to know is that it's a powerful way to
    describe data, partially because it's close to the "human way" of talking about data.

    JavaScript on the other hand is a tested and proven technology that is the de facto programming language of the web,
    and used in many webpages today (both on the front-end and back-end).

    For me these technologies are a natural match, as they are both very closely linked to the web. I believe that we'll
    see more projects using semantic technologies, and that it will be useful to implement JavaScript-based systems
    that map closely to and elevates the concepts of RDF.
