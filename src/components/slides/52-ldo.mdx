### Linked Data Objects (LDO)

<Code language="typescript" code={ldoExample}/>

<aside className="notes">
    Linked Data Objects is a relative new library. It utilizes ShEx shapes to describe data models, and provides an API
    that should be easier for JavaScript developers to understand. ShEx is yet another RDF-based standard, which might
    be an unknown standard for many. That said, I would argue that ShEx is easy to get into for developers.

    I would argue that the code here is much easier to read than the previous slide, as it relies less on RDF-specific
    concepts and is more aligned to basic JavaScript-syntax.

    Another important thing to note is that LDO encapsulates information about context so that when you've done changes
    in objects that are derived from a LDO dataset, it will know about those changes. This means that it isn't purely
    functional, and might be a turn-off for those adhering to functional programming.

    If following the functional programming paradigm is a must for you, I encourage you to check out Inrupt's JavaScript
    Client libraries.
