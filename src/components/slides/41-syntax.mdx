### Syntax

<Code language="javascript" code={basicSyntax}/>

    In this example we can see 16 statements altogether (not to be confused with RDF statements). Note that statements
    can be concluded with a semi-colon.

    JavaScript provide several ways of describing variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. The difference between them
    isn't important to understand for this presentation, but they are slightly different, e.g. `const` describes
    constants and cannot be instantiated anew (i.e. line 6 wouldn't be allowed).

    JavaScript provides several data-types, such as numbers, strings, dates, objects, arrays, sets, and functions.
    Functions can be named or anonymous, which can be shortened using a arrow notation.

    JavaScript is a dynamic language, allowing types to be defined implicitly. This means that a variable that was
    initially set as a number can be changed into containing a string. This can be very useful, but also introduce bugs
    because of unexpected types. One way of mitigating this is with types, which we can get by using TypeScript.
