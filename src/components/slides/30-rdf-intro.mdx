    RDF is an acronym for Resource Description Framework, and is a W3C standard originally designed as a data model for
    metadata. It's an abstract data model that works as a framework for representing information on the web. It's a
    semantic technology in that its fundamental building block, the triple, is based on human language.

    It's also known as Linked Data, Semantic Web, and Semantic Knowledge Graphs, and has been around for around 25
    years.
