URLs &#10084;

<aside className="notes">
    A very important part of RDF is the use of URLs, normally called addresses. A node is either a URL or a literal,
    meaning a value of some sort (e.g. strings, numbers, dates). This allow us to link data with clear, formally defined
    terms and remove ambiguity from our data models.

    Take the example of a the term `name`. Given the context it can mean a person's formal, full name, or their first
    name, or maybe even their preferred alias. Assigning URLs for each of these meaning allow us to communicate to
    others the explicit meaning you have when using that term.

    The URLs for predicates are usually grouped into vocabularies (which are themselves graphs), aka ontologies. This
    allow us to centralize URLs contextually, allowing readers to learn about sets of URLs that are useful to combine.

    (As an aside it should be noted that RDF has been spearheaded by Tim-Berners Lee, the "father of the web", who
    formally defined URL, and has been vital in the creation of RDF as well. "HTML is for communicating data to humans,
    RDF is for communicating data to machines.")
