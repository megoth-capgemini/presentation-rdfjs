### Triples

![Model of a triple with subject, predicate, and object](./triple.png)

<aside className="notes">
    A triple consists of three parts: a subject, a predicate, and an object. Triples are also called statements, as each
    triple state something.

    Triples are expressed using two nodes and a directed edge, where subject and objects are the nodes and the
    predicate is the edge between them, going from the subject to the object. Subjects and predicates are always URLs,
    while objects can be URLs or literals.

    Triples get their name from consisting of three parts, but you might also encounter the concept of quads which
    introduces a fourth part. This part is called the graph, and describes which graph the triple is part of. Another
    way of thinking about this is "who is making this statement" or "where does this statement come from".
