### Serializations

- Turtle
- JSON-LD
- RDF/XML
- and more (e.g. N3, N-Triples, TriG)
- and extensions (e.g. RDF*)

<aside className="notes">
    RDF is an abstracted data model, and doesn't specify any specific way of serializing the data. The most common ones
    you'll find on the web today is probably Turtle or JSON-LD, but you might also encounter RDF/XML, which was a
    popular serialization back in the day.

    I'll quickly show how the large data model I've used as an example earlier can be described using Turtle or
    JSON-LD. I won't go into details, but provide a simple overview.
