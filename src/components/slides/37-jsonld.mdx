### JSON-LD example

<Code language="json" code={jsonldExample}/>

<aside className="notes">
    Here is the same example described using JSON-LD. I won't go into the details here, but I would argue that JSON-LD
    is a bit more verbose that Turtle and harder to read. Some of it can be mitigated in `@context`, which I'll show in
    the next slide, but in general I prefer Turtle. The best argument for JSON-LD is that it should be more familiar to
    developers who are used to JSON.

    It should also be noted that developers can skip prefixes altogether with a well-defined @context, which might make
    it more readable.
