### RDF/JS specifications

- Specifications that allow interoperability between JavaScript libraries
- Useful when you need features from multiple libraries
- Check out [rdf.js.org](https://rdf.js.org/) for more info
  - This website also lists a lot of JavaScript tools that are interoperable with the standards

    You might not find everything you need in one library, e.g. you want SPARQL-features with tools like Comunica, but
    the simplicity of the API using LDO. In those cases you should seek out the libraries that support the RDF/JS
    specifications, which are standards that allow for libraries to be mixed.
