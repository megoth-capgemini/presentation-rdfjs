    Welcome to this introductory talk on how to manage data in RDF (aka Linked Data, aka Semantic Web) with JavaScript.

    My name is Arne Hassel, and I'm a front-ender who's very interested semantic technologies. I've developed the
    website rdfjs.dev, where I present multiple libraries and how you can use them to manage RDF. If you want to know
    more about the things I talk about in this presentation, you can check out that website.
