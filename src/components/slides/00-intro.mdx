    Welcome to this introductory talk on how to manage data in RDF (aka Linked Data, aka Semantic Web) with JavaScript.

    My name is Arne Hassel, I'm a front-ender who's very interested semantic technologies. I'm a senior consultant
    in Data Science & AI at Capgemini, based in Oslo, Norway, and my speciality is front-end and semantic graph
    technologies.

    I've developed the website rdfjs.dev, where I present multiple libraries and how you can use them to manage RDF. If
    you want to know more about the things I talk about in this presentation, I recommend you checking out that website.
    (Or contact me directly so we can talk.)
