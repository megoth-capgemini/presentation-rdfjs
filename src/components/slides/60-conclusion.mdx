## In conclusion

- Managing RDF using JavaScript is not trivial
- Difficulties can be mitigated by choosing the right tools

<aside className="notes">
    RDF can be hard to wrap your head around. As a counter-point to this argument I would argue that data modelling in
    general is hard to wrap your around in general, and RDF is complex for this reason. That said, there is a growing
    number of tools out there to make our work easier, and it's important to know which ones are available, and in which
    situations they are appropriate.
