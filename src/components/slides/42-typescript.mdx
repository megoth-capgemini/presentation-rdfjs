### Types w/TypeScript

<Code language="typescript" code={typescriptExample}/>

<aside className="notes">
    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript in that it supports all features of JS and adds more features, such as types.

    Types can be set explicitly or inferred implicitly by the TS compiler, and tell you when you try to set a variable
    that is incompatible with a given type.

    TypeScript introduces syntax that helps us in defining types, such `type` or `interface`. The differences between
    these are not important for this presentation, but know that they're useful constructs to describe complex data such
    as objects.
