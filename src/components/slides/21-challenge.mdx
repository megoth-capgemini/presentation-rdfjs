## Challenge

- Graphs are not a first-class citizen of JavaScript
- JSON is tree-based

    That said, it can be very challenging to manage RDF with JavaScript.

    First of all, RDF is graph-based, meaning that the data is described using nodes and edges, and this abstraction is
    not supported out of the box by JavaScript.

    Also, as most JavaScript developers are used to using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a tree-based way to
    describe data, it can be harder to conceptualize or get into the way of thinking about graphs.
