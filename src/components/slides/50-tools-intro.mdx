    Now, let's finally dive into two examples that allow us to manage RDF data with JavaScript today.

    Each example exposes three functions:

    1. `parseTurtle`: This function parses turtle into some object that the library use to hold the data
    2. `changeName`: This function shows how we could change the name of a given profile
    3. `serializeTurtle`: This function serializes the object back into turtle
